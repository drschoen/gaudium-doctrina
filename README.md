# gaudium-doctrina
The joy...

With each new thing learned, 
my mind is changed.
I do not remember all I have learned, 
but every modicum of knowledge, 
like acid on limestone, 
has sculpted me into a new form.
Someday, there will be no more me...
Just an infinitesimal part of an ultimate solution 
in the universal solvent of truth.
